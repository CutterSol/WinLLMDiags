# WinLLMDiags
Simple batch script for Windows AMD LLM DIags that I am currently working on. 
I am creating this script, to experiment with the development abilities of certain online LLMs, I may move development to a local LLM.  Option 6 & 7 at this time should create a report with relative information to LLMs running on a Windows system with focus on AMD GPUs (for now).  

This script might could be used as a basis for other scripts such as security testing or LLM performance, and might eventually be ported to python so that it can be run on Linux and/or Mac OSes.  Below is the main menu, which should give you an idea of what the script does.  The word "Diagnostics" is more informational, than diag at this time.      

=== Main Menu ===
1. GPU Diagnostics
2. System Information
3. Python and PyTorch Diagnostics
4. HIP Installation Diagnostics
5. Generate HTML Report from Existing Data
6. Comprehensive Diagnostics (all steps and generate HTML)
7. Open HTML Report
8. Exit
